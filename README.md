## Introduction

This is a repository where I am learning how GitHub Copilot can help improve my coding. I think this is fabulos tool, and am excited to watch it grow up.

## Positive
- I'm finding the code prediction helpful.
- It has shown me working solutions that were better than what I was going to do. 

## Challanges
- Learning to talk to Copilot takes a bit of trail and error.
