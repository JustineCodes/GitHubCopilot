## Introduction

This is a repository where I am learning how GitHub Copilot can help improve my coding. I think this is a fabulous tool, and am excited to watch it grow.

## Positive
- I'm finding the code prediction helpful.
- It has shown me working solutions that were better than what I was going to do.
- Having a chat option that is focused on code is a wonderful improvement to me workflow. Today I was able to get unstuck a few times by selecting the some code, and asking Copilot what it did, and why was I getting an error.

## Lessons
- Learning to talk to Copilot is an interesting art.
- In this current state I feel you still need a basic understanding of what you are doing. I have never coded in python and Copilot is helping with the learning curve. But it's not giving me answers like it does when I code in PowerShell.

## Python
- Tuesday the 27th of June
  - So somehow I got started trying to create a python chat with ChatGPT.
  - API set up, and hopefully I hide it in gitignore correctly.
  - Used Copilot and ChatGPT in the browser to create the code.
  - A number of errors, and the last one says. "openai.error.RateLimitError: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details." So ya that's what's up today.
